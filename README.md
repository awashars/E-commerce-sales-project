# E-commerce-sales-project

The E-commerce Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing online sales data to uncover actionable business insights and support data-driven decision-making. The primary objective of this project is to understand sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and revenue patterns across different time periods, regions, and categories.


Key metrics such as total sales, average order value, profit margin, top-selling products, customer retention, and monthly growth rate were calculated. Data visualization tools like Power BI were used to create interactive dashboards and charts, enabling stakeholders to easily track KPIs and compare performance across categories, regions, and time periods.
